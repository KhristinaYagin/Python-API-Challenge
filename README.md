We are introduced to the Geoapify API to obtain information about geographic areas and the GeoViews Python library to create maps in Jupyter Notebook. Using these new tools and data from the U.S. Census, you will create visualizations to capture the socioeconomic trend of banking deserts.
APIs in the workplace, APIs facilitate access to data or services, and will likely encounter APIs in data career. There are three types of APIs:

I. Private APIs These APIs are created exclusively for internal company purposes, and they are only accessed by company employees. Private APIs are extremely common because they can be developed quickly and don't need to be optimized for external users. Companies use private APIs to manage financial data, sales data, marketing data, HR data, and more.

II. Partner APIs Similar to private APIs, these can only be accessed by a predefined group of organizations. Partner APIs have become a revenue stream for many companies. By charging a fee for API access, companies can capitalize on work that they are already doing. Both Twitter and Pinterest use this model of development

III. Open APIs These APIs are publicly available. Open APIs are widely used, and they greatly benefit startups and entrepreneurs by eliminating development costs. Examples include OpenWeather, Skyscanner, and Yahoo Finance.
